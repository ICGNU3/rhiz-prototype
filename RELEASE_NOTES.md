## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Legacy Component Migration**: Some components still use old API response format (non-breaking)
2. **TypeScript Warnings**: Minor unused import warnings in development (non-critical)
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Ongoing improvements for mobile responsiveness
4. **Rate Limiting**: OpenAI API rate limits may affect heavy usage scenarios

### Performance Considerations
- **Cold Start**: Initial Docker container startup may take 30-60 seconds
- **AI Response Time**: OpenAI API calls typically take 2-5 seconds
- **Database Migrations**: First-time setup requires database schema creation
- **Asset Loading**: Initial page load includes comprehensive CSS and JS bundles

### Security Notes
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure all secrets are properly configured before deployment
- **Database Access**: PostgreSQL should not be exposed to public internet
- **API Keys**: Rotate keys regularly and use environment-specific keys
- **Session Security**: SESSION_SECRET must be cryptographically secure
