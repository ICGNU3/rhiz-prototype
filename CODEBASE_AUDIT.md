# Rhiz Codebase Audit & Organization Plan

## Current Working Components

### ✅ FUNCTIONAL (Ready for Use)
1. **React Frontend Routes** 
   - `/app/dashboard` - 200 OK ✅
   - `/app/goals` - 200 OK ✅  
   - `/app/contacts` - 200 OK ✅
   - Modern glassmorphism design system

2. **Flask Backend Routes**
   - Core redirects working (dashboard→/app/dashboard)
   - API endpoints for React frontend integration
   - Database connectivity established
   - Server now running without blueprint conflicts

3. **Database Layer**
   - SQLite with comprehensive schema
   - 40+ tables supporting CRM functionality
   - Models established in models.py

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL (Needs Connection)
1. **API Integration**
   - REST API routes exist but may need authentication fixes
   - Contact sync engine built but not fully integrated
   - Trust insights system needs frontend connection

2. **Authentication System**
   - Magic link infrastructure exists
   - Session management in place
   - Needs frontend auth flow completion

### ❌ NON-FUNCTIONAL (Needs Cleanup/Removal)
1. **Duplicate Templates**
   - 46 HTML templates but React frontend is primary interface
   - Many old Flask templates no longer needed
   - Inconsistent routing between old/new systems

2. **Broken Route Dependencies**
   - Intelligence routes missing network_visualization module
   - Monique CRM routes missing module
   - LSP errors throughout route files

## Cleanup & Organization Plan

### Phase 1: Remove Unused Templates & Routes
- Delete outdated HTML templates replaced by React
- Remove broken route modules
- Consolidate to essential Flask routes only

### Phase 2: Fix Core Functionality
- Connect React frontend to working API endpoints
- Fix authentication flow end-to-end
- Ensure all buttons/links lead to proper destinations

### Phase 3: Complete Integration
- Connect advanced features (Trust Insights, Contact Sync)
- Verify all React components have proper API backing
- Test complete user workflows

## Priority Actions
1. Clean up template directory (remove duplicates)
2. Fix broken route imports
3. Connect React frontend to API endpoints
4. Complete authentication integration
5. Test all navigation flows
