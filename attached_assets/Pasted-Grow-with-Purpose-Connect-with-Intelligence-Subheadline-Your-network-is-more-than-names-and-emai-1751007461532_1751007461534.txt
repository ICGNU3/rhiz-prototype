2. WHY RHIZ.AI EXISTS
Section Title:
A New Root System for Founders

Copy:
Every founder hits the same wall:
Too many contacts, too little clarity.

rhiz.ai is a goal-driven relationship system that helps you organize your connections, track momentum, and take action‚Äîwithout the noise.

Built by and for builders who believe growth should be intentional, not transactional.

Visual:
Stylized ‚Äúrhizome‚Äù map visualization showing connections blossoming outward from a goal.

3. HOW IT WORKS
Section Title:
Built to Move You Forward

Three Columns or Horizontal Cards:

Start with a Goal
Define what matters‚Äîhiring, raising, launching, or reconnecting.

See Your Network Differently
Organize contacts by goals, energy, or impact‚Äînot just name or recency.

Act with Intelligence
Smart reminders, journaling, and network nudges keep relationships alive.

Optional Visual:
Demo animation or GIF showing the user setting a goal, seeing contacts linked, setting follow-ups.

A Living Protocol for Connection

rhiz.ai is becoming more than software.
It‚Äôs a new protocol for collective growth‚Äîprivate by default, tokenized where needed, and owned by those who contribute value.
