You are building a background gamification engine for a goal-based contact intelligence app. The engine must operate invisibly—supporting the user through motivational triggers, feedback loops, and subtle rewards—without surfacing as a main tab or feature.

Build a system that:

1. Tracks XP based on user actions (e.g., adding a contact, tagging a goal, sending follow-ups).
2. Assigns levels and unlocks AI capabilities or insights at milestones.
3. Generates subtle UI feedback (like glow effects, toast alerts, or animated microrewards).
4. Offers quests (small challenges) surfaced in the Dashboard or Relationship views.
5. Supports toggle preferences (Motivated Mode, Clean Mode, Quiet Mode).
6. Remains visible only in microinteractions, not main navigation.

Constraints:
- No explicit “Gamify” section in the navigation.
- Quests and XP should appear only in goal-related or contact-related contexts.
- Streaks and achievements should be motivational, never intrusive.
- XP progression should map to user-defined goals and impact (not vanity metrics).

Example Event Triggers:
- `addContact(goalTagged=true)` → +10 XP
- `followUpContact(within3Days=true)` → +25 XP
- `reconnectDormantContact(daysInactive>90)` → +20 XP
- `completeQuest(assignedByAI=true)` → +40 XP
- `dailyStreakContinue()` → +15 XP
- `levelUpReached(newTitle=“Connector”)` → unlock insight module

Deliverables:
- XP tracker (backend object per user)
- Leveling system with milestones + unlocks
- Quest generator function (daily, weekly)
- Lightweight frontend feedback component (e.g., toast, ribbon, icon pulse)
- Settings preferences for user mood (gamified, clean, quiet)

Structure the gamification system to feel like:
> “Your network is evolving alongside your goals.”

Do **not** break immersion with dashboards, stats pages, or forced achievements. The user’s actions should create meaning passively, and rewards should mirror their real-life goals.

Output: modular system (JS or TS), with support for future multiplayer expansions.

// When user completes a meaningful action:
triggerFeedback({
  type: "toast",
  message: "🔥 You reactivated a dormant contact linked to your fundraising goal!",
  xpGained: 20,
  levelProgress: "Connector – 85% to next title",
});
