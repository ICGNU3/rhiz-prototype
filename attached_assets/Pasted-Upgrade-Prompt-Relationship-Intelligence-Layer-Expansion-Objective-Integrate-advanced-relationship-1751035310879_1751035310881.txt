Upgrade Prompt: Relationship Intelligence Layer Expansion
Objective:
Integrate advanced relationship intelligence features into our existing Flask-based app. These upgrades enhance goal-based networking, memory recovery, communication, and action tracking — all without turning it into a traditional CRM.

🔧 Add These Features:
1. Unknown But Important Contacts
Add a section called "Unknown but Important" under Contacts.

Allow users to input names or numbers without context.

Auto-tag these as "To Be Remembered".

Build an AI suggestion engine that:

Pulls clues from shared events, domains, mutuals.

Asks reflective prompts like “Did you meet at [conference]?”

Weekly email or UI notification to review these contacts.

2. Reminders & Notifications
Add automated reminders for:

Birthdays, anniversaries, check-ins (weekly, monthly, etc.)

Last interaction date → prompt follow-up if overdue

Let users customize frequency per contact.

Use a background job (e.g., Celery) to send notifications.

3. Relationship History + Timeline
On each contact’s profile:

Display a scrollable timeline of all interactions: messages, notes, meetings, tasks

Include timestamps and labels

Use SQLAlchemy relationship tables to map events to people

4. Private Journaling
Add a secure journaling panel under each contact

Support rich text + markdown

Allow date-stamped entries that stay private (not shared)

5. Contact-Based Tasks
Let users create and track to-dos linked to specific contacts

Include due dates, status (open/done), and goal alignment

Show upcoming tasks in dashboard

6. File Attachments
Add ability to upload docs (PDFs, pitches, notes) to a contact’s profile

Store using secure S3 or similar file system

Add metadata tagging for searchability

7. Mass Messaging (Warm-Up Tool)
Add ability to:

Send group texts, emails, or DMs (via integrated APIs)

Filter contacts by tag, goal, or relationship type

Include templated prompts like:

“Hey, quick check-in — I’m working on [goal] and thought of you…”

“What’s something you’re excited about this month?”

Track open/click/response rates if email/SMS provider supports it

💡 Optional (Future Prep)
Start preparing for zkSync private contact graph.

Add toggle for contacts to be included in future token graph (opt-in).

Prep API endpoints that can sync this data into a protocol version later.
