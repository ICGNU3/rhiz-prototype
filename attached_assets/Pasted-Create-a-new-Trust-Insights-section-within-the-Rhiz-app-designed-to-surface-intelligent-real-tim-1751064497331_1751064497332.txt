Create a new “Trust Insights” section within the Rhiz app, designed to surface intelligent, real-time indicators of trust, reciprocity, and relational health across the network. Trust should be measurable, emergent, and dynamic—not static or scored in a reductive way.

This feature will sit alongside Relationship Profiles and act as an adaptive “mirror” of user connections. It should help users know:

Who they’re building trust with

Who may be slipping through the cracks

Where potential trust gaps or imbalances exist

Key Features to Include:

Trust Signals Framework:

Track multi-dimensional trust signals such as:

Message response time (from both sides)

Frequency and recency of interactions (calls, texts, DMs, notes)

Mutual action history (favors, collaborations, shared events)

Sentiment tags from journal entries or follow-ups

Contact origin (how you met) and strength of introduction

Weight these signals using an evolving trust matrix.

Trust Tiers / States:

Display each connection in a tier or orbit:

Rooted (deep trust, frequent reciprocity)

Growing (promising, recent interactions)

Dormant (needs reconnection)

Frayed (low response, past unreciprocated actions)

Let users nudge or reconnect with a single tap (email, text, or prompt).

Relational Timeline View:

Create a visual map showing:

Interaction volume and type over time

Notable memory markers (notes, tags, journal entries)

Trust "climate" (calm, high-flow, strained) via color-coded ribbons

Custom Tags + AI Insight Summaries:

Let users create personal “trust cues” (e.g. “always shows up,” “tends to ghost”).

Auto-summarize trends in a contact’s behavior:

“You usually reach out first”

“Haven’t interacted in 90 days”

“Responds within a day 70% of the time”

Trust Health Score (Optional, Not Public):

Provide users a private, AI-generated trust health readout of their own behaviors:

“You ghosted 3 contacts this month”

“You haven’t followed up with X since they did Y”

Offer suggestions: “Send a follow-up,” “Revisit this note,” “Acknowledge their contribution”

Data Privacy + Transparency:

All trust insights are for the user only.

Do not create public-facing scores.

Allow users to turn off insights for specific contacts or signals.

Frontend:

Create a modular dashboard section using React/Tailwind:

Trust Map

Sentiment Stream

Recency Tracker

Call-to-Action Buttons (Follow-Up, Reconnect, Reflect)

Backend:

Extend relationship model to support:

trust_signals[]

trust_tier

last_trust_insight_generated_at

reciprocity_index

Use cron jobs or event-based triggers to update trust data.

Build AI summaries using OpenAI or Claude integration with embeddings for past entries.
