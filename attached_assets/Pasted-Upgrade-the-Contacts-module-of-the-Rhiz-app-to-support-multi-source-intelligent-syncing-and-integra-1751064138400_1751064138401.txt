Upgrade the Contacts module of the Rhiz app to support multi-source, intelligent syncing and integration. The current one-by-one upload interface should be replaced with a robust system that allows users to import and manage contacts in bulk from multiple platforms.

New Features to Build:

Multi-Source Syncing:

Integrate APIs for:

Phone Contacts: Use Google People API and Apple Contacts API (via OAuth).

LinkedIn: Use OAuth + scraping fallback if LinkedIn API access is limited.

X.com (Twitter): Use Twitter API v2 to pull followers/following with metadata.

Email Providers: Gmail/Outlook contact list sync.

CSV Upload: Support large file uploads, clean mapping of fields.

Auto-Merge & Deduplication:

Create a normalization engine to detect and merge duplicates using fuzzy matching on:

Name

Email

Phone

Social handle

Add manual override tools to merge/split entries if needed.

Enrichment Layer:

Automatically enrich contacts with:

Profile picture (Gravatar, LinkedIn, X.com)

Bio / headline

Last interaction timestamp

Tags based on profession or relationship type

UI Improvements:

Design a React-based, responsive dashboard using Tailwind CSS.

Display enriched contacts in a scrollable list with:

Profile picture, name, title, origin source (LinkedIn, Phone, etc.)

Tag chips

Action buttons: "Map to Goal", "Add Note", "Message"

Smart Filters & Search:

Add filter options:

Source (Phone, LinkedIn, X.com)

Status (Dormant, Active, Engaged)

Tags or relationship type

Search by name, tag, or keyword across all notes and metadata.

Privacy & Consent:

Ensure GDPR-style data control and explicit consent flow for all synced data.

Allow users to export, delete, or redact any contact information.

Backend Support:

Add background job queue (Celery or RQ) for syncing large lists without UI blocking.

Store synced data in normalized form in PostgreSQL or a graph DB.

Extend relationship object schema to include source, sync_status, and enrichment_status.

Goals:

Move from manual data entry to a seamless network import system.

Empower users to visualize their extended graph faster.

Allow AI agents to activate previously unknown but important contacts (e.g., via signal propagation or suggestion).

Build the foundation for relationship intelligence across platforms.

Important: Do not break existing contacts stored manually. Treat them as one of many sources in the new system.
