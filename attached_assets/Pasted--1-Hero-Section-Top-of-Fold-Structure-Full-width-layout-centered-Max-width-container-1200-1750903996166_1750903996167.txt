🎯 1. Hero Section (Top of Fold)
Structure:

Full-width layout, centered

Max width container: 1200px, padding: 40px

Content:

Headline (H1):
Start with a goal. Organize your connections. Take action.
Font: Inter / Geist / Söhne, weight: 600, size: 48px

Subhead:
You already know what you’re building. Now you need to move faster—through the people you know and the ones you forgot.

Font size: 20px, weight: 400

CTA Button:
Create Your First Goal →
Rounded corners, large button (width: auto, padding: 16px 32px), dark background, hover glow

Visual Element (right side if split screen):
Either:

Animated graph of contact suggestions popping up from a goal card

Or a sample AI message generation preview

Recommendation: Use a light background with soft drop shadows, rounded visual cards, slight motion blur for the AI effect.

🧭 2. How It Works (Step Cards)
Layout:

Horizontal or vertical 3-step card layout

Each card is visually numbered (1–3)

Each Card Contains:

Title: e.g., 1. Set a goal.
Font: 24px, bold

Description: e.g., Fundraise, hire, launch, grow. Start with one clear direction.
Font: 16px, normal

Optional micro-illustration icon (e.g., goal target, contacts, AI brain)

🧠 3. Features Section
Layout:

Grid format (2x2) or vertical stacked features with icon to left

Icons should be clean, not playful

Each Feature Contains:

Feature Title (18–20px, bold)

Description (14–16px)

Examples:

Goal-Based Matching – Everything orients around what you’re trying to do now.

Smart Suggestions – The system watches your intent and recommends real people to reach out to—today, not someday.

Use subtle hover or fade animations for modern polish. Features can expand slightly on hover.

🕸️ 4. Visual Network Map Preview (Optional Hero-Style Section)
Full-width section

Headline: Visualize your network. Move with precision.

Subtext: See how your people connect. Find bridges, gaps, and clusters.

Live or simulated SVG-style force map visual (interactive optional, animated ideal)

🔐 5. Philosophy Strip (Optional)
Background: Light gray or contrasting card strip
Text centered or in left column:

Quote-style bold line:
Your goal isn’t contacts. It’s outcomes.

Supporting text:
Founders shouldn’t waste time managing relationships. You should be deepening the right ones, guided by where you're headed.

✅ 6. Final CTA Section

Repeat core headline:
Start with your next move. Let the system handle the rest.
