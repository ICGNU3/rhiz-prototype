Magic Link → Full App Flow
1. Verify Identity

Store session token in cookies or secure storage.

✅ Output: Logged-in session established, user lands in-app.

2. Welcome + Quick Intent Prompt

“What brings you here?” with tags: Reconnect, Build, Map, Collaborate, Fundraise, Explore

“Who are you most trying to connect or activate?” (contacts, communities, funders, collaborators)

✅ Output: Initial personalization layer for recommendations, flows, and network sorting.

3. Contact Sync & Import
Ask user to sync contacts or upload from:

Phone (CSV or VCF)

Google Contacts (OAuth flow)

LinkedIn (manual or plugin)

Twitter/X follows (if auth available)

Also include: “Add manually” and “Skip for now”

✅ Output: Base network graph initiated. Sync is optional but heavily nudged.

Your synced contacts as nodes.

Visual trust score (shaded ring, for example).

Filter and search functions.
