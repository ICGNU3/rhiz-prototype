# OuRhizome UX Analysis - World-Class Standards Assessment

## Executive Summary

**Overall UX Grade: B+ (82/100)**

OuRhizome demonstrates strong technical foundation and innovative AI features, but suffers from information architecture complexity and lacks world-class onboarding. The platform has excellent potential with significant UX improvements needed for optimal user experience.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Navigation Cognitive Overload (Severity: HIGH)
**Current State:**
- 7 top-level navigation items
- Intelligence dropdown with 6 sub-items (violates Miller's Rule of 7Â±2)

- Features scattered across multiple sections
- No clear user journey or progressive disclosure

**Recommendations:**
- Replace "Rhizomatic Analysis" with "Network Patterns"

- Implement breadcrumb navigation
- Add contextual help tooltips

### 3. Onboarding & Empty States (Severity: CRITICAL)
**Current State:**
- No guided first-run experience
- Generic empty state messages
- Users dropped into complex interface without context

**Solution Created:**
âœ… Built comprehensive 4-step onboarding flow
