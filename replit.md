# Rhiz - Contact Intelligence CRM

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Flask-based contact intelligence and CRM system specifically designed for founders to manage their network relationships with AI-powered insights. The system combines traditional CRM functionality with advanced AI features including semantic goal matching, natural language query processing, and intelligent outreach suggestions.

## System Architecture

The application follows an enhanced Flask MVC architecture with AI-powered contact intelligence:

- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5.3 responsive UI with dark theme, featuring dashboard views, Kanban pipeline, and natural language interface
- **Backend**: Flask web framework with Python 3.11, modular CRM intelligence system
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive contact relationship schema supporting warmth tracking, interaction logging, and pipeline management
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for embeddings, content generation, and natural language processing
- **CRM Intelligence**: Advanced contact scoring, outreach suggestions, and relationship pipeline management
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn WSGI server with autoscale deployment on Replit

## Key Components

### Database Layer
- **SQLite Database**: Single-file database (`db.sqlite3`) for simplicity and portability
- **Models**: Object-oriented database access through custom model classes (`User`, `Contact`, `Goal`, `AISuggestion`, `ContactInteraction`)
- **Schema**: Well-structured tables supporting users, contacts, goals, AI suggestions, and interaction tracking

### AI Integration
- **Embeddings**: Uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model for semantic vector representations
- **Content Generation**: Leverages GPT-4o for personalized outreach message creation
- **Similarity Matching**: Cosine similarity algorithm to match contacts with goals

### Web Interface
- **Dashboard**: Overview of goals, contacts, and AI-powered insights
- **Goal Management**: Create and manage founder objectives with AI processing
- **Contact Management**: Maintain network relationships with detailed profiles
- **AI Suggestions**: View and act on intelligent contact recommendations

### Core Features
- **Semantic Goal Matching**: AI analyzes goal descriptions and contact information to suggest relevant connections
- **Personalized Outreach**: Generates custom messages based on goals and contact context
- **Interaction Tracking**: Maintains history of contact engagements
- **Demo Data Seeding**: Automatically populates sample data for demonstration

## Data Flow

1. **Goal Creation**: User creates a goal → System generates embedding → Stores in database
2. **Contact Management**: User adds contacts with notes → Data stored for AI analysis
3. **AI Matching**: System calculates cosine similarity between goal and contact embeddings
4. **Suggestion Generation**: Top matches presented with confidence scores and generated outreach messages
5. **Interaction Tracking**: User actions and follow-ups recorded for relationship management

## External Dependencies
